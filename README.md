# Tutoring_solution_LLM_comparison

This project aimed to harness the creative capabilities of different large language models (LLMs) by asking each to propose a design for an innovative tutoring system. The goal was to see how each model approached the challenge and to compare their design concepts.Using the API calls for each LLM, the following models were tested and results compared side by side. 

OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)

Anthropic (Claude 3 Sonnet)

Google (Gemini 2 Flash)

DeepSeek

Groq (LLaMA 3.2 and LLaMA3.3)
